# TODO: Fix Particles and Header Not Appearing

- [x] Update Header.jsx: Change Spline import to '@splinetool/react-spline' to match App.jsx, and add styles to main tag for full viewport size and positioning.
- [x] Verify Particles container div has proper size and visibility in App.jsx.
- [x] Test the rendering after changes.
